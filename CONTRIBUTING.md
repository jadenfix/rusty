# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Two things matter more than anything else here: commits
that follow the standard, and pull requests a person would enjoy reading.

## Commits: Conventional Commits 1.0

Every commit subject follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<optional scope>)<optional !>: <description>

<optional body: why, not what>

<optional footers, e.g. BREAKING CHANGE: ..., Refs: #12>
```

| type | use it for | release |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | something users can do that they couldn't before | minor |
| `fix` | a bug fix | patch |
| `perf` | faster or cheaper, same behaviour | patch |
| `refactor` | restructuring with no behaviour change | none |
| `docs` | documentation only | none |
| `test` | adding or fixing tests | none |
| `build` | Cargo, Docker, dependencies | none |
| `ci` | workflows | none |
| `style` | formatting only | none |
| `chore` | everything else that ships nothing | none |
| `revert` | undoing an earlier commit | depends |

The rules:

- Description in the imperative, lower case, no full stop, 72 characters or
  fewer: `fix(compact): keep the user's messages verbatim`.
- Scope is optional and names the area: `agent`, `tools`, `permissions`,
  `memory`, `context`, `display`, `ui`, `llm`, `skills`, `evals`, `cloud`.
- A breaking change gets `!` after the type or scope, plus a
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer that says what breaks and how to migrate.
- The body explains **why**. The diff already shows what.
- One logical change per commit. If the subject needs "and", it's probably two
  commits.

Turn on the local check once per clone:

```bash
cargo xtask install-hooks
```

CI runs the same check on every commit in a pull request, and on its title.

## Pull requests

Write pull requests the way you'd explain the change to a teammate over
coffee. That means:

- **Plain, human language.** Short sentences. Say what was wrong, what you
  changed, and why this approach. Skip the buzzwords and the walls of
  bullet points.
- **No tool attribution.** Don't mention AI assistants, coding agents or any
  tool that helped write the change, and don't add "generated with" lines or
  co-author trailers for tools. You're the author and you own the change.
- **Show it works.** Say how you tested it. For anything visible in the
  terminal, include a before-and-after capture.
- **Small and focused.** One idea per pull request. The title follows the same
  Conventional Commits format as a commit subject.

The template in `.github/pull_request_template.md` keeps this short.

## Before you push

```bash
cargo xtask qa         # fmt, clippy -D warnings, unit and end-to-end tests
cargo xtask qa --live  # needs NVIDIA_API_KEY: live tests, terminal checks, evals
```
