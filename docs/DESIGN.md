# Design notes

rusty is meant to be the coding agent you'd keep open all day: quick for small
jobs, dependable over long ones, and honest about what it spends. This page
explains why it's built the way it is.

## What coding agents are good at today

- **Local edits with fast feedback.** Read a file, change it, run the test,
  fix the error. When the loop is short and the signal is clear, current
  models are excellent.
- **Finding things with terminal tools.** Most of the real progress in agents
  came from treating the shell as the interface: `grep`, `rg`, `find`, `git`,
  the build, the tests. These tools are fast and precise, and every model
  already knows them.
- **Reading unfamiliar code.** Given the right ten files, a model can explain a
  system faster than most people.

## Where they fall apart on long tasks

| Failure | What it looks like | What rusty does |
|---|---|---|
| **Context rot** | After an hour the agent forgets a constraint you set at the start, or redoes finished work. | A fixed token budget per section. Old tool output gets trimmed first, since it can be re-read, and only then are older turns summarised. Your messages are carried through every compaction **word for word**, and the plan and goal are pinned outside history. |
| **Lossy compaction** | The summary drops the task itself, and the agent asks "what would you like to do next?" | The same verbatim carry-over, plus compaction can cut mid-turn, so a single long autonomous turn can still be compacted (that bug is covered by a test). |
| **Premature "done"** | It says it's finished without running anything. | Goal mode only ends through `goal_done`, which requires evidence. Every other ending means "keep going", up to a turn cap. |
| **Doom loops** | The same failing command, eight times. | Repeated identical calls in one turn get a note telling the model to step back and change approach. |
| **Amnesia** | Every session relearns how to run the tests. | Typed memories ranked by BM25 against each request and injected within a budget. Compaction also pulls lasting facts out of the turns it summarises. |
| **Memory junk drawers** | A notes file that grows forever and gets pasted into every prompt. | Records, not a file. Near-duplicates merge, stale entries can be forgotten, and only the relevant few are injected. |
| **Permission fatigue** | Prompts for `ls` train people to approve everything, and then something risky slips through. | A classifier: reads and normal build/test commands just run, and anything that deletes, leaves the project, rewrites history or touches the network asks. |
| **Exploration flooding context** | Fifty file reads to answer one question. | `outline` and `glob` show structure without file bodies, and subagents and swarms explore in their own context and return only a report. |
| **Invisible cost** | You find out what it spent when the bill arrives. | Per-turn recaps, `/tokens` broken down by model and by tool, per-request traces on disk, and tips based on what each turn actually spent. |
| **Hard to interrupt** | Ctrl-C kills the process or does nothing until the stream ends. | Requests run on a background thread, so Ctrl-C stops a turn mid-stream (about 1 ms in tests). The transcript stays valid and the next turn works. |

## Execution depth

Execution mode is separate from permission mode. `standard` keeps the existing
loop. `vibe` uses a smaller output and reasoning budget and enables bounded
read-only research workers by default. `careful` uses a larger inference budget
and intercepts completion proposals to run two additional review passes.
The reviews remain in the same transcript and their usage is counted.
They are model-driven reviews with tools available, not hidden grading or
proof that every critical invariant holds. Explicit model and delegation
choices override the profile defaults. Provider-specific reasoning fields
are scoped to the documented NVIDIA Super endpoint to preserve compatibility.

## First principles for tools

An agent's tools should be the ones a strong engineer reaches for in a
terminal, shaped so each call returns as little as possible while still
answering the question.

1. **Locate before you read.** `search` (ripgrep, smart case, per-file caps,
   optional context lines and globs) answers "where", `glob` answers "which
   files", and `outline` answers "what's in here" with signatures and line
   numbers. Only then `read_file`, for a range.
2. **Exact edits.** `edit_file` replaces one unique string. It fails loudly
   when the match is ambiguous and never guesses.
3. **The shell for everything else.** `bash` runs builds, tests, git and
   one-off scripts, with a timeout, interrupt support and output capped
   head-and-tail so the error at the end is never lost.
4. **Every output is bounded.** Long results are capped and marked as
   truncated, and old results shrink as the conversation grows.

## Token allocation

The window is split into allowances: system and project instructions,
memory (3k chars), pinned plan and goal, a 16k reply reserve, and history.
When history passes 60% of its share, old tool output shrinks. Past 80%, older
turns are summarised. Measured token counts from the API are shown after every
turn, so you always know where you stand.

Delegation is also a token decision. A subagent spends its own context on
exploration and hands back a page. A swarm does the same in parallel, with a
fixed report budget split across its workers so a big swarm can't flood the
main context. Both are off by default; `/agents auto` lets rusty pick the
lightest option that works.

## Things rusty deliberately doesn't do

No telemetry. No auto-commits or pushes. No attribution trailers. No flattery.
No giant system prompt. No silent truncation. No surprise token burn. No
lock-in: any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works.

## Next

- Parallel tool calls within a single turn
- Checkpoints and `/undo` built on git
- MCP client support
- A sandbox mode (container or seatbelt) for unattended runs
- Retrieval over the repo for very large codebases
